## My Learnings

Building this project in such a short span of time, along with End Semester Exams certainly wasn't easy, but it taught me so much that it was worth every effort!

I got the chance to apply my knowledge from the Google Data Analytics certificate, learn flask, and most importantly build models, all the while keeping in mind what the user would want and expect from the project.
